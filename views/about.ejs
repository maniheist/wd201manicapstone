      A learning management system (LMS) is a software application for the
      administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, automation, and
      delivery of educational courses, training programs, materials or learning
      and development programs.The learning management system concept emerged
      directly from e-Learning. Learning management systems make up the largest
      segment of the learning system market. The first introduction of the LMS
      was in the late 1990s.Learning management systems have faced a massive
      growth in usage due to the emphasis on remote learning during the COVID-19
      pandemic.Learning management systems were designed to identify training
      and learning gaps, using analytical data and reporting. LMSs are focused
      on online learning delivery but support a range of uses, acting as a
      platform for online content, including courses, both asynchronous based
      and synchronous based. In the higher education space, an LMS may offer
      classroom management for instructor-led training or a flipped
      classroom.Modern LMSs include intelligent algorithms to make automated
      recommendations for courses based on a user's skill profile as well as
      extract metadata from learning materials to make such recommendations even
      more accurate.

    <p style="color: red">
      An LMS delivers and manages all types of content, including videos,
      courses, workshops, and documents. In the education and higher education
      markets, an LMS will include a variety of functionality that is similar to
      corporate but will have features such as rubrics, teacher and
      instructor-facilitated learning, a discussion board, and often the use of
      a syllabus. A syllabus is rarely a feature in the corporate LMS, although
      courses may start with a heading-level index to give learners an overview
      of topics covered.

    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 58, 100)">Technical Aspects</h1>
    <p style="color: red">
      An LMS can be either hosted locally or by a vendor. A vendor-hosted cloud
      system tends to follow a SaaS (software as a service) model. All data in a
      vendor-hosted system is housed by the supplier and accessed by users
      through the internet, on a computer or mobile device. Vendor-hosted
      systems are typically easier to use and require less technical expertise.
      An LMS that is locally hosted sees all data pertaining to the LMS hosted
      internally on the usersâ€² internal servers. Locally hosted LMS software
      will often be open-source, meaning users will acquire (either through
      payment or free of charge) the LMS software and its code. With this, the
      user is able to modify and maintain the software through an internal team.
      Individuals and smaller organizations tend to stick with cloud-based
      systems due to the cost of internal hosting and maintenance.[19] There are
      a variety of integration strategies for embedding content into LMSs,
      including AICC, xAPI (also called 'Tin Can'), SCORM (Sharable Content
      Object Reference Model) and LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability). Through
      an LMS, teachers may create and integrate course materials, articulate
      learning goals, align content and assessments, track studying progress,
      and create customized tests for students. An LMS allows the communication
      of learning objectives, and organize learning timelines. An LMS perk is
      that it delivers learning content and tools straight to learners, and
      assessment can be automated. It can also reach marginalized groups through
      special settings. Such systems have built-in customizable features
      including assessment and tracking. Thus, learners can see in real time
      their progress and instructors can monitor and communicate the
      effectiveness of learning.One of the most important features of LMS is
      trying to create a streamline communication between learners and
      instructors. Such systems, besides facilitating online learning, tracking
      learning progress, providing digital learning tools, managing
      communication, and maybe selling content, may be used to provide different
      communication features.
